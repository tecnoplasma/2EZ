// Include necessary libraries
- Include wire communication library
- Include sensor library for BNO055
- Include servo motor control library
- Include Pixy2 camera control library
- Include NeoPixel LED control library

// Define constants and initialize variables
- Define LED pin, count, brightness
- Define sensor pins: right trigger (rt), right echo (re), left trigger (lt), left echo (le), front trigger (ft), front echo (fe)
- Define motor control pins: forward, backward, enable, standby
- Initialize flags for u-turn, sensor status, mid-turn, and other state indicators

// Initialize devices
- Initialize BNO055 sensor, Pixy2 camera, NeoPixel LED strip, and servo motor
- Set motor direction (forward by default)

// Main loop
- While the robot has not completed 12 turns:
  - Sense current time for delays
  - If not in mid-turn or dodge, move forward
  - Measure distance from front sensor (fd)
  - Capture Pixy2 blocks (objects)
  - Determine which block is larger and react accordingly (if red or green object is detected)
    - If red block detected, prepare for right dodge
    - If green block detected, prepare for left dodge

  - Switch between states:
    - **Straight**: 
      - If front distance is below threshold, check right and left distances and decide on turning
    - **Left**: 
      - If front distance is below threshold, initiate left turn
    - **Right**: 
      - If front distance is below threshold, initiate right turn
    - **Dodge Left**: 
      - Perform left dodge using Pixy2 block data for height and position
    - **Dodge Right**: 
      - Perform right dodge using Pixy2 block data for height and position

// Functions:
- **Calculate angle error** between target and current heading, account for angle wrapping
- **Update target heading** based on current direction (right/left turns)
- **Turn left or right**: adjust servo angle to perform turn
- **Forward movement**: use PID control to adjust steering based on angle error
- **Distance calculation**: trigger ultrasonic sensors and measure echo time for distance measurement

// Handle special conditions such as u-turns, parking logic, and sensor deactivation during certain actions
